      "content": "ECALTECH Center aims to become the central place of a set of infrastructures related to the teaching and practice of technologies. \n\nTodayâ€™s digital age has radically changed the way we work and ECAL, in its constant pursuit of excellence, must always be at the forefront. \n\nIn recent years, we have observed that all the training courses we provide in our institution increasingly use a variety of technologies. These sometimes take the form of creative tools, but are also indispensable as a support for the projects themselves. \n\nThe pedagogical results acquired today are already very promising, but a certain number of parameters can still considerably increase the quality of the use of these technologies. We must gather, promote and perpetuate this know-how. \n\nToday, we also have an opportunity to create more links with the innovative industries in our region and wish to bring together major players from outside the school to do applied design research with our students."
